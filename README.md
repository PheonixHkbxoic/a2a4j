agent to agent scenarios with google a2a protocol

* Seamless Agent Collaboration: Introduces a standard protocol for autonomous, opaque agents built on different
  frameworks
  and by various vendors to communicate and collaborate effectively with each other and with users, addressing the
  current
  lack of agent interoperability.
* Simplifies Enterprise Agent Integration: Provides a straightforward way to integrate intelligent agents into existing
  enterprise applications, allowing businesses to leverage agent capabilities across their technology landscape.
* Supports Key Enterprise Requirements: Offers core functionalities essential for secure, enterprise-grade agent
  ecosystems, including capability discovery, user experience negotiation, task and state management, and secure
  collaboration.

## Open standards for connecting Agents

* MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tools and resources
    * Connect agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs.
    * Google ADK supports MCP tools. Enabling wide range of MCP servers to be used with agents.
* A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol) for agent-agent collaboration
    * Dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents without sharing memory, resources, and tools
    * Open standard driven by community.
    * Samples available using Google ADK, LangGraph, Crew.AI
